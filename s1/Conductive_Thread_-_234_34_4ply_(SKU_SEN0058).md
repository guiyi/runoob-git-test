<p><a href="image:Conductive_Thread_SEN0058.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb</a>==Introduction==<strong>Conductive thread</strong> is a creative way to connect various electronics onto clothing. This thread can carry current for power and signals. While not as conductive as traces on a printed circuit board (PCB), this thread makes wearable clothing 'wearable'!We have worked with our supplier to change how to thread is manufactured to decrease the fray-resistance. This new thread is more expensive but the quality and the fray-resistance has increased significantly. Now you can worry less about short circuits and worry more about your project.This is a thicker thread with a lower resistance that can be used with hand sewing. Resistance is about 14 Ohms per foot. Spool contains 1oz of thread, about 75 yards.<br /><br /><a href="image:nextredirectltr.png" title="wikilink">image:nextredirectltr.pngGo</a> Shopping <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/product-235.html">Conductive Thread - 234/34 4ply (SKU:SEN0058)</a><a href="category:_Product_Manual" title="wikilink">category: Product Manual</a><a href="category:_DFR_Series" title="wikilink">category: DFR Series</a><a href="category:_Hardware-Mechanical" title="wikilink">category: Hardware-Mechanical</a></p>---
