<p><a href="image:DFR0003.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb|400px|<a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/product-358.html">Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3</a>The</a> DFRobot <em>DFRduino ATMega1280 MEGA USB Microcontroller</em> is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega1280 integrated circuit. It 00% same as the original <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/product-358.html"><u>Arduino Mega</u></a>.It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with an AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. The Mega is compatible with most shields designed for the Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila. The DFRobot ATMega1280 MEGA USB Microcontroller can be powered via the USB connection or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically. External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector. This board is almost identical to the Arduino MEGA with the exception of the color of the PCB.==Specifications==*Microcontroller ATmega1280 *Operating Voltage 5V *Input Voltage (recommended) 7-12V *Input Voltage (limits) 6-20V *Digital I/O Pins 54 (of which 14 provide PWM output) *Analog Input Pins 16 *DC Current per I/O Pin 40 mA *DC Current for 3.3V Pin 50 mA *Flash Memory 128 KB of which 4 KB used by bootloader *SRAM 8 KB *EEPROM 4 KB *Clock Speed 16 MHz ==Shield Compatibility==The Mega is designed to be compatible with most shields designed for the Diecimila or Duemilanove. Digital pins 0 to 13 (and the adjacent AREF and GND pins), analog inputs 0 to 5, the power header, and ICSP header are all in equivalent locations. Further the main UART (serial port) is located on the same pins (0 and 1), as are external interrupts 0 and 1 (pins 2 and 3 respectively). SPI is available through the ICSP header on both the Mega and Duemilanove / Diecimila. Please note that I2C is not located on the same pins on the Mega (20 and 21) as the Duemilanove / Diecimila (analog inputs 4 and 5).The Mega is compatible with#Arduino Mega Prototype Shield #Arduino I/O Shield #<a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1084.html">Arduino LCD Shield</a> #<a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/product-59.html">Arduino Motor Shield</a> The Mega is NOT compatible with 'Arduino Ethernet Shield' ==Documents==<a href="http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/images/9/96/Mega_V1_sch.png">DFRduino Mega(Arduino Mega Compatible) Schematics</a><br /><a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMega">Arduino Mega Overview</a><a href="image:nextredirectltr.png" title="wikilink">image:nextredirectltr.pngGo</a> Shopping <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/product-50.html">DFRduino Mega(Arduino Mega Compatible) (SKU:DFR0003)</a>Category: <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/"><strong>DFRobot</strong></a> &gt; <strong><a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/category-35.html">Arduino</a></strong> &gt; <strong><a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/category-104.html">Microcontroller</a></strong><a href="category:_Product_Manual" title="wikilink">category: Product Manual</a><a href="category:_DFR_Series" title="wikilink">category: DFR Series</a><a href="category:_MicroControllers" title="wikilink">category: MicroControllers</a></p>---
