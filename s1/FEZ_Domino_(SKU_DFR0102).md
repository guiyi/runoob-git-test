<p><a href="image:DFR0102.jpg" title="wikilink">thumb</a>]FEZ (Freakin' Easy!) is a tiny open-source board running <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/netmf/default.mspx">Microsoft .NET Micro Framework</a>. This means, you can write code with much more efficiency using C# programming language under free Microsoft Visual C# express. Build your next projects in minutes by connecting FEZ Domino to one of the shields or the many available components. Includes USB cable.You can see that FEZ Domino's outline looks similar to Arduino Duemilanove. The reason for this compatibility is that many shields already exist for the Arduino board. TinyCLR.com offers several shields (Ethernet, Display, Motor Driver, etc.) that are fully tested and supported with FEZ Domino. Furthermore, with the FEZ Domino Expansion shield and onboard extension header, the user can easily add extensions and components. This allows FEZ Domino to remain simple yet extremely flexible, making it one of the easiest devices to use in the embedded market. Developers, professionals, and hobbyists can now create a multitude of designs using simple plug-in components. Many libraries come included, such as FAT file system, threading, UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO, PWM, ADC, DAC, CAN and more. To get started with FEZ, please take a look at the FEZ Tutorial and .NET Micro Micro Framework Beginners. Guide available on <a href="http://www.tinyclr.com">www.tinyclr.com</a>Many libraries are already included like FAT file system, threading, USB Client, USB Host, UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO, PWM, ADC, DAC and many more.==FEZ Domino and Arduino Compatibility==The similar form factor between FEZ Domino and Arduino allows developers to use almost any of the available Arduino shields. While using the same shields, FEZ offers greater flexibility and far more features. Starting with Microsoft Visual C# Express and the possibility for debugging and ending with high-end libraries like USB host, USB device, threading, XML and many others. Not to forget that FEZ Domino has extra 8 IOs at the UEXT connector and the USB host, USB device, SD card are all connected directly to the processor and so using those will not reduce your free IO count. (we use SD in real SD mode which requires 6 pins). Note that all digital/analog pins, PWM, COM1 and SPI are in the same place, other peripherals can be different. For example FEZ Domino provides three serial ports that are available for developers. Arduino only has one and it is used for debugging!==Specification==*72Mhz 32-bit ARM*USBizi-144 Chipset*User free FLASH :148KB*User free RAM: 62 KB*Programmable IO:36*6 PWM channels*6 Analog Input*1 Analog Output*3 TTL UART(COM)*2 SPI*Support I2C*Support CAN Bus*USB Host: HUB, joystick, keyboard, mouse, printer, CDC, virtual serial and custom*SD/MMC Card:Built in 4-bit Micro SD Connector*Real Time Clock(RTC):Build in*Battery Backup RAM:2KB*Active Power Consumption:110mA*Idle Power Consumption: 65mA*Hibernate:12.5mA*Operating Temperature:-40° to +85°*RoHS Compliant: Yes==Installation Steps==*Step 0: Get the version we use to update the Firmware and Upgrade Firmware <a href="http://www.ghielectronics.com/downloads/general/teraterm_utf8-4.53.zip">Download</a>*Step 1: Install Microsoft Visual C# Express <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CS">Download</a>*Step 2: Install Microsoft NETMF 4.1 SDK <a href="http://www.ghielectronics.com/downloads/NETMF/GHI%20NETMF%20v4.1%20SDK.zip">Download</a>*Step 3: Install GHI NETMF USB Drivers 32-Bit/64-Bit Auto Installer (optional) <a href="http://ghielectronics.com/downloads/NETMF/GHI%20NETMF%20USB%20Drivers%2032-Bit.zip">32 Bit</a> <a href="http://ghielectronics.com/downloads/NETMF/GHI%20NETMF%20USB%20Drivers%2064-Bit.zip">64 Bit</a>==Reference==*<a href="http://www.tinyclr.com/hardware/1/fez-domino/">Domino Website</a>*<a href="http://www.tinyclr.com/downloads/Domino/Broch_FEZ_Domino.pdf">Brochure and Pinout</a>*<a href="http://www.tinyclr.com/downloads/Domino/FEZDomino%20Design.zip">Design File</a>*<a href="http://www.tinyclr.com/downloads/Domino/FEZDomino_sch.pdf">Schematics</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="image:nextredirectltr.png" title="wikilink">image:nextredirectltr.pngGo</a> Shopping <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/product-342.html">FEZ Domino-an Microsoft .NET Micro Framework powered controller</a><strong>Category</strong>: <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/">DFRobot</a> &gt; <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=35">Arduino</a> &gt; <a href="https://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=35_104">Microcontroller</a><br /><br /><a href="category:_Product_Manual" title="wikilink">category: Product Manual</a><a href="category:_DFR_Series" title="wikilink">category: DFR Series</a><a href="category:_MicroControllers" title="wikilink">category: MicroControllers</a></p>---
